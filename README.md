Cyber Warfare Intrusion Detection System using SVM to detect malicious network traffic. It performs EDA, feature encoding, and scaling, and trains an RBF-kernel SVM. A probability-based approach classifies traffic as Normal, Suspicious, or Malicious, with real-time user-input predictions for practical cybersecurity analysis.
